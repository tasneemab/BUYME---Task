# BUYME--Task

This is a task manager (todo-app) that was developed using Laravel and phpMyAdmin in the backend and Embe.js for the frontend.

It's a CRUD app, you can add a new task, edit or delete an existing one and display the whole tasks which exist in the db.

#Frontend
1. Click the task inorder to edit it
2. Click the checkbox inorder to mark the task as completed
3. Click the right X to delete the task completetly
4. To add a new task click the route "New Task" in the navbar then it'll take you to a templete there you can see an input where you can write a new task on it inorder to add it, also you can mark it as comleted or not (It sounds like logical to add a task which is done but however sometimes people wants to know what they have done not only the things they are going to do.


Run ember serve for the frontend server
Run php artisan serve for the backend server
Must add your DB namein the env. file in the backend
